# Abstract 

Soils and sediments are soft, amorphous materials with complex microstructures and mechanical properties, 
that are also building blocks for industrial materials such as concrete. These Earth-mediated materials evolve under prolonged environmental pressures like mechanical stress, chemical
gradients, and biological activity. Here, we introduce geomimicry, a new paradigm for designing
sustainable materials by learning from the emergent and adaptive dynamics of Earth-mediated matter. Drawing a parallel to biomimicry, we posit that these geomaterials follow evolutionary design
rules, optimizing their structure and function in response to persistent natural forces. Our central
argument is that by decoding these rules, primarily through understanding the emergence of novel
exotic properties from multiscale interactions between heterogenous components, we can engineer a
new class of adaptive, sustainable matter. We propose two complementary approaches here. The
top-down approach looks to nature to identify building blocks and map them to functional groups
defined by their mechanical (rather than chemical) behaviors, and then examine how environmental
training tunes interactions among these groups. The bottom up approach seeks to leverage and
test this framework, building earth materials one component at a time under prescribed fluctuating
stresses that guide assembly of complex and out-of-equilibrium materials. The goal is to create
materials with programmed functionalities, such as erosion resistance or self-healing capabilities.
Geomimicry offers a pathway to truly design Earth-mediated circular materials, with potential applications ranging from climate-resilient soils and smart agriculture to new insights into planetary
terraforming, fundamentally shifting the focus from static compositions to dynamic, evolving systems that are mediated via their environment.
