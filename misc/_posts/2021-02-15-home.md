Shravan is a postdoctoral researcher working with [Doug Jerolmack](https://earth.sas.upenn.edu/people/douglas-j-jerolmack){:target="_blank"} ([Penn Soft Earth Dynamics Lab](https://pennsed.seas.upenn.edu/){:target="_blank"}) and [Paulo Arratia](https://directory.seas.upenn.edu/paulo-e-arratia/){:target="_blank"} ([Penn Complex Fluids Lab](https://arratia.seas.upenn.edu/){:target="_blank"}) at the University of Pennsylvania. His research interests lie in the "Water-Energy-Food Nexus", where he aims to: (i) engineer sustainable soft materials and complex fluids with tailored mechanical properties; (ii) accelerate technologies for applications in resilient and precision agriculture, bioseparations, carbon storage, and terraforming planetary regoliths; and (iii) develop experimental, data-driven constitutive models for coupled transport–mechanics problems. Shravan adopts a <i>materials geomimicry</i> approach—drawing inspiration from the hierarchical structures found in soils—to design novel materials and processes with advanced mechanical and transport properties. His convergent scientific strategy sits at the intersection of soft particulate rheo-tribology, colloid and surface science, materials chemistry, sustainable geomaterials, living matter-mediated transport, non-linear dynamics, and autonomous experimentation.
